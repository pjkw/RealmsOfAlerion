Okay, so we created an account to use Midjourney image generation.

Now we need to generate an image of a farm. We will use that image to create a farm card.

When a farm or village card is clicked, then we will spawn a hex tile on the map, which the player can move around with the mouse and then finalize by left clicking.

After that we will update the player's inventory to reflect them buying a farm or village.

Since the farm card will be used a lot (and the village card),
we can have different graphic representations of farms, while still
having the same functionality.

We should build a tutorial mode, right alongside the game,
so that the player can learn how to play the game, and we 
can stay organized.
